        <h1>Welcome to Ki Jong's Web Page!</h1>
        <p>I'm Ki Jong. I'm 52 years old, and immigrated to US last year with my family. I have a wife and two daughters. Here is what I want to do in the future :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting a job as a software engineer.</li>
            <li>Living in a house where I can cook BBQ for my family and neighbors.</li>
            <li>Working hard to stay fit.
                <ul>
                    <li>Being able to do more than 10 pull-ups.</li>
                    <li>Being able to do more than 15 dips</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Camping at great places in US.</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="tilt">It's my first time building my personal website. I will try to add more later on. But, that is all for now. Please, enjoy some of my pictures below. Thank you.</p>
